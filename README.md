# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Html to Be
Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial), possibly the greatest
beginner Html tutorial in the history of the Universe.

You should totally [check it out](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial), and be sure to [join the email list](https://www.learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

It's worth noting that the course is no longer free, really useful for me when it was.
